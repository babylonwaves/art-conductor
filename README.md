# Art Conductor Articulation switching presets

Art Conductor is a collection of articulation switching presets for all major DAWs. The presets make it easy to control a sampler instrument, especially orchestral instruments, perfectly. They allow you to work faster and get better results by using different articulation depending on how you want your instrument sound.
Art Conductor is a one stop solution, supporting more than 1000 commercial sample libraries. All you need to do is to load a preset (a Cubase expression map, or a Logic articulation set etc.) and the corresponding instrument. Then you assign articulations to your melody and the DAW automatically selects the correct playing technique when you play back your melody.


This repository contains a full list of all sample libraries supported by Art Conductor in JSON format.
